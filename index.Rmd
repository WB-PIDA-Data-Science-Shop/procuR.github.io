# Welcome to the *procuR* Project

This repository hosts documentation, source materials, and analytical methodologies for working with public procurement contract data.

The data-cleaning codebase is currently under development; therefore, the analysis pipelines presently rely on data from the [`ProAct data`](https://www.procurementintegrity.org/data/). At this stage of the project, datasets can be downloaded on a country-by-country basis from ProAct and integrated into the pipeline to generate analytical outputs.

## 📘 About this repository

This repository contains:

- `index.Rmd` — this homepage  
- `integrity_report.Rmd` and `integrity_report.R`— analysis of public procurement transparency 
- `admin_eff_report.Rmd`and `admin_eff.R` — analysis of public procurement administrative efficiency
- `econ_out_report.Rmd` and `econ_out.R` — analysis of public procurement economic outcomes
- Supporting datasets, scripts, and rendered outputs (`.html`, `.tex`)

All files are generated using R and the [`rmarkdown`](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) package.

## 🔍 Thematic fields and analytical frameworks

This section provides access to the main analytical modules implemented in the project. Each module focuses on a distinct thematic dimension of public procurement performance and applies a harmonized data-processing and indicator framework.

- **[Integrity Analysis](integrity_report.html)**  
  Analysis of transparency and accountability challenges in public procurement systems using procurement data.

- **[Administrative Efficiency Analysis](admin_eff_report.html)**  
  Assessment of procedural efficiency, administrative burden, and implementation performance in procurement processes.

- **[Economic Outcome Analysis](econ_out_report.html)**  
  Evaluation of procurement outcomes, including competition, pricing efficiency, and broader economic impacts.

- **[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/WB-PIDA-Data-Science-Shop/procuR.github.io)**  
  Full source code, documentation, and reproducible analysis pipelines.

## 📚 Data standards, references, and useful resources

This section documents the data foundations of the project, including input data sources, qualitative benchmarks, methodological references, and reusable data templates supporting replication and extension.

- **[Open Public Procurement Data Sources](helpers/data_source_ref.html)**  
  Overview of major open public procurement datasets, their coverage, update frequency, formats, and processing status.

- **[Qualitative Assessment Sources](helpers/qual_assessment.html)**  
  Comparative qualitative frameworks and expert assessments of public procurement systems.

- **[Example Studies and Projects Using Procurement Quantitative Indicators](helpers/proc_ind_ex.html)**  
  Empirical studies and applied projects demonstrating the use of procurement indicators across thematic areas.

- **[Data Processing Approaches and Templates](helpers/data_process.html)**  
  Methodological guidance, processing pipelines, and variable templates for transforming raw procurement data into analytical datasets.

- **[Data Template](helpers/dataindex.html)**  
  Standardized data structure and variable definitions used across analytical modules.

## 📈 How to Reproduce the Analyses

To reproduce the analyses on your local machine, you will need the following:

- **R**: version **4.5.1** or newer
- **RStudio** (Posit): recommended
- **The relevant ProAct dataset**, downloaded separately
- **Analysis files from this GitHub repository**:  
  <https://github.com/WB-PIDA-Data-Science-Shop/procuR.github.io>

For each thematic analysis, two files are required:

- `.utils.R`  
  An R script that implements the data-processing and analysis pipeline.  
  This script contains parameters that may need to be adapted for new countries
  (e.g. time coverage, filtering rules, or threshold values).

- `_report.Rmd`  
  An R Markdown file that generates the analytical report (HTML, DOCX, or PDF),
  including tables and figures.
